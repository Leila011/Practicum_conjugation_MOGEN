## Learning outcomes
By the end of the practicum, you should be able to:  

- Conduct, plan and execute an experiment to extract genomic DNA and plasmid DNA from a bacterial strain, and visualize the results on an agarose gel.  

- Derive hypotheses for the differences in genome organization (presence of plasmid, yes or no) based on observations of the organisms environment, and lifestyle.  

- Explore horizontal gene transfer in bacterial cultures, by transfer of the plasmid encoding for the green-fluorescent protein, between bacteria.  

- To develop skills in molecular biology, and sterile techniques for handling bacterial cultures.  

- Interpret and compare gel results with fluorescence microscopy images, gfp-expression and the working of a fluorescence microscope.  

- Learn how to report against report guidelines.
