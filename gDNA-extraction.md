## On-campus

Follow the instructions of the assistant to perform the gDNA extraction.  
During the first 30 minute break (incubation step at 37°C):  
- Find a covid-safe spot to work on your laptop and look up what each product does in the process of DNA-extraction.  
During the second 30 minute break (incubation step at 56°C):  
- Find a covid-safe spot to work on your laptop and search the growth characteristics of your receptor strain: where was it found, which growth medium can it use, does it has plasmids?  
Tip: use the NCBI website and the accession number of your strain to query, given on page 4 of the manual.  

Lunch break

Follow the instructions of the assistant to perform the plasmid extraction.  
The procedure is different then the gDNA extraction, how and why?  

Follow the instructions of the assistant to load your gDNA and plasmid DNA on the gel.  
You will receive the gel results the next day in the morning.

## Online

- Based on the email instructions you should have signed up for [praxilab](https://praxilabs.com/en/sign-up).
- Click on the module: DNA extraction, enter the virtual lab, and follow the DNA-extraction protocol that the virtual instructor gives you.  
Click on the robot to let him speak.

After you finish the DNA-extraction, ssearch what each product in the DNA-extraction kit does.  
You have used different products to extract the DNA then your colleagues in the wet lab.  
The products you used are the following, what is the typical composition of the products you used, why, what happens with the DNA in each step?  
- RNAse A  
- Lysis solution  
- Phenol chloroform  
- Chloroform  
- Ethanol (70 % and 90%)  
- TE elution buffer  

How does it differ from the protocol your colleagues used. What are the advantages, disadvantages?  

Lunch break

Read the instructions how to perform a plasmid DNA extraction in the lab manual (there is no virtual module for this).  
The procedure is different then the gDNA extraction, how and why?  

Follow the instructions of the assistant to load your gDNA and plasmid DNA on the gel.  
You will receive the gel results the next day in the morning.
